# 2D-AI-Game-Engine

We have  been thinking a lot about artificial intelligence lately, and it's clear that AI has made incredible strides, but there's still one area where it falls short – basic problem solving and puzzle-solving.
So, here's an idea I've been working on to take AI to new heights: creating a 2D AI engine that specializes in solving games and puzzles using the magic of machine learning and other awesome technologies.

It's like having a brilliant puzzle-solving buddy right at your fingertips. This AI could be a game-changer, helping us tackle complex problems and unlocking new possibilities we can't even imagine yet.

This game engine can make playing with computer more fun then ever by making the computer learn with us and improve while playing with us.
